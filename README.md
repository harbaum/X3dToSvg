# X3dToSvg

This is an attempt to render a 3D X3D format into the 2D SVG vector
format in order to be able to use [fischertechnik Designer
files](http://www.3dprofi.de/de/) inside documents.

Currently most people simply use bitmap graphics for this. But
this results in huge files which don't scale well.
